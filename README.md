## Project: Solving the heat equation using high order methods on Stampede2 Supercomputer at Texas Advanced Computing Center ([Report](https://github.com/mashadab/Tools-and-Techniques-in-Computational-Science/blob/main/proj2/Project2_report.pdf), [YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4WwXOMeBo4&t=1s))
In this project, I performed testing mainly verification, regression, and runtime performance. I have also used these libraries: GRVY for timekeeping and debugging, MASA for method of manufactured solutions, bash automated testing system (bats) for designing regression tests. Finally, I have shown some results and compared them with analytical results. Moreover, I added code coverage using gcov, output file formatting using Hierarchical Data Formatting (HDF5), Portable Extensible Toolkit for Scientific Computation (PETSc) library with GMRES solver integration and finally performed the continuous integration using Travis.
